        <p>Dear TSTS,</p>
        <p>I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I love you and how much you mean to me. You are the light of my life and every day with you is a blessing.</p>
        <p>My love, I am sorry if I ever did or said anything that made you feel sad or unhappy. You are the most precious thing in my life, and I am committed to making you feel loved, cherished, and respected every day. Thank you for being by my side and for always bringing so much light and joy into my world.</p>
        <p>You inspire me to be a better man every day and I am grateful for the love that we share.</p>
